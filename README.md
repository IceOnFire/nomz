nomz

The definitive economy for the new millenium.

What the hell are you talking about?
------------------------------------

Do you want to make a lot of money? Why? Just for having money or do you want to buy something with it? Nomz is just this: it shifts the attention from money to goods and services, which are the real value produced by us humans.

What is a nom?
--------------

A nom is just a placeholder for barter. Say you offer a good to me and I offer a good to you, but my good is worth less than yours. I will then give you some noms that represent the difference, and you can spend those noms to get other goods from me or from other people.

Big deal, you just discovered money.
------------------------------------

Not really. Noms are a little different:

- Noms have no way to be changed in "real-world" currency. They only exist in the nom world.
- Their value is fixed and will never be subject to inflation: the nom currency is related to energy, and one nom corresponds exactly to 1000 kcal (equivalent to a hearty meal). This does not mean you pay a meal its equivalent in calories: plesae read on.
- There are no banks or miners that coin new currency: every new person that joins this economy causes the economy itself to grow.
- Noms can have only positive integer values: there is no debit of noms and no rounding profits.
- Noms cannot be exchanged, traded or donated. If you have zero noms, the only thing you can do to gather some is to do some work.

But Nomz is not only about noms. It's about value. Follow me...

Goodz
-----

A good is a product or service provided by someone. This is the real fulcrum of everything. A good features:

- Type
- Class (high quality, low-cost, ...)
- Rating/reviews by users
- State (used, brand new, ...)
- Availability (if the good can be purchased for a limited time)
- Price

As for the price, here's the innovative stuff: the price is open source. It's not just a number, it's a tree structure with the final price as the root and the price of every step used to obtain the good in every other node. This means that you can always know exactly why the good you're purchasing is so expensive: you can track the price of production, transport, distribution, promotion etc. And if you know a way for cheaper transportation you can break the price chain by contacting the producer directly and use your own transport means.

Moreover, the atomic price of a single good (which we call value) is transparent and determined by many factors:

- The minimum value, which is the cost of production
- The mean value perceived by the users for a good type, following the principle of "wisdom of the crowd"
- The value perceived by the producer for her/his particular good item (which will be slightly higher than the minumum, if the produces thinks that the mean value is way too low)
- The final value of the item, altered by its rating

As you can see, even though the system is quite complicated it aims at being completely transparent and democratic as possible.
