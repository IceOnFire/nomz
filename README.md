nomz
====

The definitive economy for the new millenium.

What the hell are you talking about?
------------------------------------

Do you want to make a lot of money? Why? Just for having money or do you want to buy something with it? Nomz is just this: it shifts the attention from money to goods and services, which are the real value produced by us humans.

What is a nom?
--------------

A nom is just a placeholder for barter. Say you offer a good to me and I offer a good to you, but my good is worth less than yours. I will then give you some noms that represent the difference, and you can spend those noms to get other goods from me or from other people.

Big deal, you just discovered money.
------------------------------------

Not really. Noms are a little different:

- Noms have no way to be changed in "real-world" currency. They only exist in the nom world.
- Their value is fixed and will never be subject to inflation: the nom currency is related to energy, and one nom corresponds exactly to 1000 kcal (equivalent to a hearty meal).
- There are no banks or miners that coin new currency: every new person that joins this economy causes the economy itself to grow.
- Noms can have only positive integer values: there is no debit of noms and no rounding profits.
- Noms cannot be exchanged, traded or donated. If you have zero noms, the only thing you can do to gather some is to do some work.
